Facial Recognition Camera Challenge

I was not able to complete the challenge in the 3 hour time slot.
Feel free to download this repository and see what was completed.

Further Considerations:
This is my first attempt at prototyping an app in Swift 3 and this was a great learning experience.
I have been coding iOS mostly in Objective-C as of late. I learned iOS development in Swift 2.0 so I feel that that learning curve when initially starting the project got me off to a bad start.
I should have done more research into best ways to capture images automatically and not wasted my time with old ways like PhotoPicker.

Thank you for your time!
I will finish this in my free time.
